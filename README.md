# dotfiles
my personal dotfile collection for configuration my shell on a new machine

## goal
I would like to set up zsh on my machine without oh-my-zsh to see if I can, I have existing old configs to pull from
I want ot keep things clean and minimal

## wishlist
- I want all my aliases loaded
- I want .vimrc with the remapping and potentially pathogen and vim plugins
- I love dracula theme so I want that everywhere
	- terminal dracula theme
	- vim dracula theme
	- if I decide to incorporate tmux, dracula theme there
- I want a fancy prompt that tells  me useful things
- I want to use the lsd rust project and have it on my path so my ls command gives nicer output
- I want zsh-autosuggestions plugin and appropriate key bindings
- I want zsh completions and appropriate keybindings
- I want history substring search
- I want zsh-syntax-highlighting
- I want vi-mode in zsh with the mapping of 'jj' to '<Esc>'
- I want good and explicit management of PATH that is documented, so that python and scala work well
